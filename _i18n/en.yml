  vara_headline: "Since we use Starred the Net Promoter Score of our studio audience went up with more than 20%"  
  vara_text: "As an innovative public broadcasting organisation we are constantly looking for improvements and that’s why it’s essential to listen to our audience. BNN-VARA is not only interested in the feedback of our studio audiences but also in the user experience of our customer service and webshop. Since we use Starred the Net Promoter Score of our studio audience went up with more than 20% because we are watching the feedback closely, improve wherever that’s possible and communicate back to the audience. Sometimes we invite them back to attend another show. That’s hugely appreciated."
  dp_headline: "Starred epitomizes: The answer is yes, now what is the question?"
  dp_text: "Starred are a young, friendly and dynamic company; nothing is too much trouble for them. They epitomise ‘the answer is yes, now what is the question?’ Starred has brought the voice of our customer into our day to day discussions as well as more formal business reviews. It is a powerful tool that is driving behaviour change in a subtle yet fast way. Implementing a customer satisfaction feedback tool in six countries across Europe has been quick and easy to do. This is thanks to the support of the Starred team and the ease of use of the Starred tool. The tool also has a ‘light touch’ that our customers seem to appreciate; we are very pleased with our response rates."
  cp_headline: "I think Starred is a top application!"
  cp_text: "Met Starred hebben wij op een eenvoudige manier een klanttevredenheidsonderzoek opgezet waarvan de hoge response ons duidelijke inzichten geeft in de winkelervaring van onze diverse klanten, via de verschillende channels van Centralpoint.nl. Eventuele ontevreden klanten worden door ons nagebeld en daar wordt zeer positief op gereageerd. Door de overzichtelijke feedback in Starred kunnen wij Centralpoint.nl continue blijven verbeteren. Ik vind Starred een top-applicatie!"
  dqna_headline: "Starred is a perfect match with DQ&amp;A's mission to optimize based on data driven insights."

Starred is a perfect match with DQ&A's mission to optimize based on data driven insights. Our clients appreciate to be able to share their feedback very efficiently."
  wehkamp_headline: "Starred gives us insight into which aspects of our business drive customers to recommend wehkamp to others or not"
  wehkamp_text: "As a retail brand we’re constantly searching for the most important attributes for our customers to value us, or not. We have been looking for the right solution for measuring continuously, on scale, and cost efficiently. Starred allows us to monitor our customer ratings real-time. For the first time we can get insights into which aspects of our business drive customers to recommend wehkamp to others or not. That’s of great value to us."
  mvo_headline: "Ever since we started evaluating our events through Starred, the number of participants that give feedback afterwards has risen by over 25%"
  mvo_text: "Ever since we started evaluating our events through Starred, the number of participants that give feedback afterwards has risen by over 25%. We’re happy about this development, for only if we know how our business relations experience the events, we will know how to improve upon them. We think the high response rate is the result of Starred’s accessibility when it comes to filling in the surveys (feedback forms of one single page) combined with its personal approach (e-mail invite with photo). The fact that the software is incredibly easy to use, is a big plus, especially for those who have less feel for IT. As such, Starred has provoked many positive reactions within MVO Nederland itself."
